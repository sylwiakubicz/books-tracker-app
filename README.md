<h1>Pandary API</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
The backend of the Pandary application is powered by Spring, providing a robust and scalable API that supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all database tables. The database structure consists of several interconnected tables, including users, books, authors, genres, statuses, and user roles, allowing for comprehensive management of a personal library. The backend manages all user interactions such as retrieving book details, updating reading statuses, and administering user accounts. It serves as the backbone of the application, efficiently handling all the business logic and data persistence, while interacting with the frontend to deliver a seamless experience to both administrators and users.
